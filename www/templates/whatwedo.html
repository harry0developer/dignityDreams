    	Enabling small business

		<div class="item item-text-wrap">
		Currently there are 19 previously disadvantaged and unemployed women who sew Dignity Dreams pads and bags.  These women ‘own’ their businesses because we don’t set targets on the units they make, but we undertake to purchase all their stock. Strict quality control measures are in place.

 		Caring for our environment
		</div>
		<div class="item item-text-wrap">
		Traditional sanitary towels and tampons are clogging up our landfills and polluting our environment. A cycle normally lasts for 5 days and most girls and women use 5 sanitary towels per day i.e. 5 towels x 5 days = 25 per month. This means that over a 5 year period 1 500 soiled towels will end up in landfills.  Dignity Dreams packs will last for 5 years. According to Food & Tress for Africa survey, we only use 17 trees per year.
