		Dignity Dreams is a Non-Government Organisation (NGO) which focuses on helping South Africa’s young girls and women meet their personal hygiene requirements. Dignity Dreams has given 19 previously unemployed women the opportunity to run their own businesses by training them to sew its products. The overarching goal of Dignity Dreams is to ensure that every underprivileged girl and woman in South Africa – and beyond – receive a Dignity Dreams pack so that they are able to attend school, university or work.

		Dignity Dreams provides feminine, washable and reusable sanitary wear which can be used for up to five years, SABS absorbency approved, making a huge difference in the day-to-day lives of schoolgirls who would otherwise stay away from school. Part of our promise is to disseminate information about Menstrual Health. During our surveys girls reported some form of vaginal infections – due to the fact that they were using rags, paper, socks etc. – because they did not have access to sanitary towels.
